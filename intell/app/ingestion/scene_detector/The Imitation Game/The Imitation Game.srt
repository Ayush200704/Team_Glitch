1
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,240
This war...

2
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:12,820
We're not winning it.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,540
If you speak a word of what I'm about to show you, you will be executed for high treason.

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:18,920
It's beautiful.

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,240
It's the greatest encryption device in history and the Germans use it for all communications.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,460
Everyone thinks Enigma is unbreakable.

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,700
Let me try and we'll know for sure.

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,980
Mr. Turing, do you know how many died because of it?

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:33,780
I don't.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,460
Three.

11
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,660
While we've been having this conversation.

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:39,820
Gentlemen...

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,540
Meet Mr. Turing.

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,880
We are to work together, then?

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,580
I'm afraid these men would only slow me down.

16
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,060
Popular at school, were you?

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,040
We're short on staff.

18
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,480
We get more staff, then.

19
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,280
You have six minutes to complete the task.

20
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,420
Is that even possible?

21
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,060
No.

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:54,700
Takes me eight.

23
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,920
Five minutes and thirty-four seconds.

24
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,220
You said to do it in under six.

25
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,800
What is it that we're really doing?

26
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,080
We're going to break an unbreakable Nazi code and win the war.

27
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh...

28
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,400
You know, to pull off this irascible genius routine, one actually has to be a genius.

29
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,680
I'm designing a machine that will allow us to break every message every day.

30
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:18,720
Instantly.

31
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,620
You're going to need all the help you can get.

32
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,580
And they are not going to help you if they do not like you.

33
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,080
Have you decrypted a single German message?

34
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,720
You will never understand the importance of what I am creating here!

35
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,200
Our patience has expired.

36
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,040
No!

37
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,420
If you fire Alan...

38
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,720
Well, then, you'll have to fire me.

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,860
Me, too.

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,580
And me.

41
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,420
It had better bloody work.

42
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,840
Alan, you do not have to do this alone.

43
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,260
What are you doing?

44
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:49,940
What's going on?

45
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,200
The Navy thinks that one of us is a Soviet spy.

46
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,440
You've got more secrets than the best of them.

47
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,160
What if I don't fancy her in that way?

48
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,580
You can't tell anyone, Alan.

49
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,300
It's illegal.

50
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,640
I'm just a mathematician.

51
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,060
Sometimes, it is the people who no one imagines anything of.

52
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,420
Who do the things that no one...

53
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:13,900
Can imagine.
